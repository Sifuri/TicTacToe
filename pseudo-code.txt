Object Oriented Path:

Create a human class with methods for moving
Create a Machine class with methods for moving, and assuming various levels of skill {novice, intermediate, advance}
Create a Game_Board class with methods for {New Board, Display Board}
Create an Instructor or Referee class with methods for {Starting game, display instructions, congratulate winner, play_again? }
